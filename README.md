- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Chris1871
- Iâ€™m interested in all things cybersecurity, red and blue team.
- I have been focused on Penetration Testing for the last few years and have the OSCP, OSWP and HTB CBBH certifications and continue to work on more.
- I have also been focused on the defensive side of things, working as an Information Security Analyst.
- I spend a lot of my free time doing CTFs on Hack the Box, Proving Grounds or learning new skills from various platforms such as HTB, TryHackMe, Sektor 7 and MalDev Academy.
